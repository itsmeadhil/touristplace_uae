          Umm Al Quwain Fort, also known as the Al Ali Fort, is located in the city of Umm Al Quwain in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It was the seat of the rulers of Umm Al Quwain and the centre of government in the emirate until 1969. It was used as a police station before the fort was restored and opened to the public in 2000 by Sheikh Rashid Bin Ahmed Al Mualla, the Ruler of Umm Al Quwain at the time.

          Today it houses the Umm Al Quwain National Museum. Exhibits include artefacts from the important archeological site of Ed-Dur.
          
          The Fort is located in the Madeena Al Qadeema or old souq area of Umm Al Quwain, the most traditional remaining area of the emirate's capital.[        </div>

          Falaj Al Mualla is the inland oasis town of Umm Al Quwain, one of the seven emirates which comprise the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Originally called Falaj Al Ali, after the Al Ali tribe which settled Umm Al Quwain, Falaj Al Mualla is located some 30 km inland of the city of Umm Al Quwain.[1] It was settled approximately at the same time as the Al Ali moved from the island of Sinniyah to the mainland after water supplies on the island were exhausted.

Falaj Al Mualla is notable for its fort and also three watchtowers (east, west and north), which guard the fertile wadi. It is also the site of a bathing house, built in the early 19th century – as was the fort – by the Ruler of Umm Al Quwain, Abdullah bin Rashid Al Mualla. The construction of the fort has been dated back to 1825
